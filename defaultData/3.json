    "description": "A black panther-like Pokémon with electric sparks crackling along its fur. It crouches in a dense jungle during a storm, with glowing yellow eyes staring fiercely at its prey. Thunderclouds loom in the background, and a flash of lightning illuminates its sleek, muscular body. Its fangs glow with a dark aura as it prepares to strike. The Pokémon card has a sleek Electric/Dark design, with a jagged lightning bolt pattern along the border.",
