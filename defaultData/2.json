    "description": "A sleek, serpentine Pok√©mon with shimmering blue scales and glowing fin-like spines running along its back. Its long body twists through an underwater coral reef, with bubbles rising around it. Its eyes glow a bright cyan, and water energy swirls around its mouth as it prepares to unleash a powerful attack. The card background features ocean waves, with Water and Dragon-type symbols on the side, and the attack moves displayed in an elegant format.",
