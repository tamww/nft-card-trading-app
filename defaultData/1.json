    "description": "A fierce, lion-like Pokémon with a fiery mane intertwined with thorny vines, standing in a volcanic jungle. Its claws glow with ember energy as flames swirl around its paws. The background shows a blazing forest, with embers rising into the smoky sky. The Pokémon's eyes burn with determination, and its tail flickers with green and red flames. The card design is sleek, featuring a Grass and Fire energy symbol at the top, with damage stats and attacks displayed below.",
