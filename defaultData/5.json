    "description": "A massive, rock-armored pterosaur PokÃ©mon with jagged stone wings and a glowing gemstone in its forehead. It soars above an ancient canyon as dust storms swirl beneath it. Its wings leave a trail of stone debris as it flaps powerfully. The card features a cracked stone border, with Rock and Flying energy symbols glowing in the background.",
